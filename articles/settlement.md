In 1793, Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, named Scarborough after the town of the same name in England. The area attracted its first agricultural settlers soon after. Scottish settlers, David and Mary Thomson, were the first to arrive in about 1799, settling along Highland Creek. The area remained primarily a farming community until well into the 20th century.[Canadian Encylopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/scarborough)
